    <h1>The <i>best</i> motherfucking website</h1>
    <div>For real.</div>
    <h2>Styling?</h2>
    <p>
      You probably build websites using vim and you think that's hardcore. You
      think your 4.99KB
      <span style="color: #730000">motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is going to
      get you some award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your
      default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, guess what, you're <u style="color: #c0392b">WRONG</u>,
      motherfucker.
    </p>
    <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
    <p>
      Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of
      the past <span style="color: #730000">motherfuckingwebsites</span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB
        cat picture below is removed)
      </li>
      <li>
        The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" style="color: #941352"
          >Google home page</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your 16x32
        Tamagotchi, I'm sorry)
      </li>
      <li>Looks <i>almost</i> the same on every screen</li>
      <li>
        Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem
        <span style="font-size: 5px">well, kind of</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">acessible</a> so everyone
        can enjoy it
        <span style="font-size: 5px"
          >but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Shit is <i>even more</i> legible than the fucking two previous versions
        - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" style="color: #0077aa"
          >ARPANET</a
        >
        website
      </li>
      <li>
        Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people
        who still use
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers"
          style="color: #0077aa"
          >IPoAC</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Uses only free and open-source resources, like this awesome font called
        "Open Sans"
        <span style="font-size: 5px">which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking
        styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is
        proudly made with plain HTML5, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!
      </li>
      <li>Doesn't include any tracking service</li>
      <li>
        Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <i>JUST USE IT</i> .
      </li>
      <li>Use <i>some</i> fucking colors.</li>
      <li>
        Links don't really need to keep that
        <span style="color: #0000ee">shitty blue</span> the browser is giving
        them: nor that violetish color when they are marked as visited. Just
        give them a
        <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa" style="color: #0077aa"
          >nice color</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
    <p>
      This website is even better than the last
      <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" style="color: #941352">guy</a>
      and the
      <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" style="color: #941352"
        >guy before him.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It's over a <a href="https://www.google.com/">secure connection</a> - so
        nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different
        for everyone, pshht!).
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses one of the most general
        <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">gTLDs</a> available out
        there: .website
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses the TLD, too: thebestmotherfucking.website, check out
        <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">domainr</a> to do something
        cool too.
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses the kickass
        <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Let's Encrypt</a> CA (don't
        you see the gorgeous lock?)
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses
        <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">a custom version</a> of the
        awesome
        <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">ultra-lightweight jQuery</a>
        <strong>/s</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best
        thing - if the user's browser is outdated they will notice and maybe
        they will switch
        <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">from the cra</a>p they use
        to <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">a much cooler browser</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript
        <img
          style="display: inline-block"
          src="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/static/dd60b11e9762b6e25f6d4ce981a1eeae.svg"
          alt="JavaScript logo"
        />, CSS3 CSS3 logo and HTML5 HTML5 Logo
      </li>
      <li>
        Freaks who are scared of JavaScript will feel safe here since the
        website doesn't need to have JS enable to be properly rendered
      </li>
      <li>It supports HTTP/2</li>
      <li>
        It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious
        bandwidth if you visit the website more than once
      </li>
      <li>It allows universal access from every website via CORS</li>
      <li>It is Accessible</li>
      <li>
        It is hosted on GitHub Pages, making it almost free to keep this website
        alive
      </li>
      <li>
        It's Open Source, freely available on GitHub, and everybody can
        contribute to it.
      </li>
      <li>
        It uses the WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License, which
        is pretty clear on what you can and what you can't do:
      </li>
    </ul>
